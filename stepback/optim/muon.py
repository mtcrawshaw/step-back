    Newton-Schulz iteration to compute the zeroth power / orthogonalization of G. We opt to use a
    quintic iteration whose coefficients are selected to maximize the slope at zero. For the purpose
    of minimizing steps, it turns out to be empirically effective to keep increasing the slope at
    zero even beyond the point where the iteration no longer converges all the way to one everywhere
    on the interval. This iteration therefore does not produce UV^T but rather something like US'V^T
    where S' is diagonal with S_{ii}' ~ Uniform(0.5, 1.5), which turns out not to hurt model
    performance at all relative to UV^T, where USV^T = G is the SVD.

    Muon - MomentUm Orthogonalized by Newton-schulz

    Muon internally runs standard SGD-momentum, and then performs an orthogonalization post-
    processing step, in which each 2D parameter's update is replaced with the nearest orthogonal
    matrix. To efficiently orthogonalize each update, we use a Newton-Schulz iteration, which has
    the advantage that it can be stably run in bfloat16 on the GPU.

    Some warnings:
    - We believe this optimizer is unlikely to work well for training with small batch size.
    - We believe it may not work well for finetuning pretrained models, but we haven't tested this.

    Arguments:
        named_params: Names and parameters to be optimized. We need the parameter names
        here in order to determine whether each parameter should be optimized with Muon
        or Adam.
        architecture: Name of architecture. Used to perform aforementioned parameter sorting.
        lr: The learning rate. The updates will have spectral norm of `lr`. (0.02 is a good default)
        momentum: The momentum used by the internal SGD. (0.95 is a good default)
        nesterov: Whether to use Nesterov-style momentum in the internal SGD. (recommended)
        ns_steps: The number of Newton-Schulz iterations to run. (6 is probably always enough)
        lmo: Whether to use LMO instead variational viewpoint of gradient descent to derive
        update rule. If lmo=False, update is additionally scaled by the dual norm of the
        gradient.
        l2_prod_norm: Whether to use the L2 norm for the product space over layers
        instead of the max norm, which scales each layer's LR by the nuclear norm of the
        gradient.
        nuc_approx: How to approximate the gradient nuclear norm. Choices: [None, 'fro', 'past']
        rms_layer_norm: Whether to use the RMS norm the input/output space of each
        layer, which scale each layer's LR by sqrt(fan_out/fan_in).
        adamw_params: The parameters to be optimized by AdamW. Any parameters in `muon_params` which are
        {0, 1}-D or are detected as being the embed or lm_head will be optimized by AdamW as well.
        adamw_lr: The learning rate for the internal AdamW.
        adamw_betas: The betas for the internal AdamW.
        adamw_eps: The epsilon for the internal AdamW.
        adamw_wd: The weight decay for the internal AdamW.
